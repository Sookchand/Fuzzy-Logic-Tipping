# Fuzzy Logic Tipping
This is a solution to the problem of determining the suggested tip for a restaurant based on the quality of food and service. The solution uses Scikit-Fuzzy, a fuzzy logic library for Python, to create a control system that takes inputs for the food and service quality, and outputs a suggested tip percentage.
